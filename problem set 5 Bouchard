Monday: 

1.) Starbucks wants to evaluate whether their mobile pay solutions are having a positive impact on customer service. Outline how they might collect data to answer this question using:

A. An Observational Study
"first person"
+ natural settings (in situ), direct info, develop intuitions
- Personal biases, some things can't be observed, can't be recaptured, recreated or replaced
Ex: sensor readings, sensory (human) observations, survey results


If I were to use an observational study to help starbucks evaluate whether their mobile pay solutions was having a positive impact on customer service I would be most interested in observing how many people were using the mobile pay vs. cash. I might also consider looking at how long people wait in line when using mobile pay and the type of products they are purchasing. Although this is something that can be done through in person observation, I believe that a quick customer survey would be more ideal. The way I might come to a conclusion about customer satifsaction is by observing whether the amount of people using mobile pay exceeds people using regular paying methods. 


B. Focus Groups

With this data collecting method I would be able to focus on a small group of participants and focus only on what I need to know. This method is useful for when short on time and need this information quickly. I would ask particpants what they prefered between mobile pay and traditional forms of payment. I might also ask what their general thoughts were about the service and whether they believed it provide a more positive experience for them when going to Starbucks. Obviously this type of method could result in biases, however, it would be useful for achieving a general sense of what customers were thinking. 

+lots of data in a short time, targetd data, cheap
-Measure percieved behavior, questions can easilty bias(people tend to agree with concesnsus of group)

C. An Online Survey

I believe that this method of data collecting would be most efficient in 

Be sure to identify what the procedure would look like, what data you would obtain, and what questions you could answer using this data. 

2.) In 2014, Facebook conducted their infamous Emotional Contagion study where they manipulated users' newsfeeds to contain differing amounts of positive and negative content. Name the (a) research question, (b) independent variables, and (c) dependent variables that Facebook used in this study. 

3.) What kind of data collection strategies would you use to:

A. Determine user perceptions of a social media campaign

B. Assess the effectiveness of a web redesign

C. Decide whether the next iPhone will live up to its hype (and turn a profit)

Be certain to provide a sufficient justification for why you feel this method is correct.
